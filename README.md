## How to flash custom ROMs

Two custom ROMs can be installed: one for the 48K architecture and another for the 128K architecture.

The "Update firmware" option is now changed to the "Update" menu with three options: firmware, custom ROM 48K, and custom ROM 128K.

Just like updating the firmware requires a file named "firmware.bin" in the root directory of the SD card, for the emulator to install the custom ROMs, the files must be placed in the mentioned root directory and named as "48custom.rom" and "128custom.rom" respectively.

For the 48K architecture, the ROM file size must be 16384 bytes.

For the 128K architecture, it can be either 16kb or 32kb. If it's 16kb, the second bank of the custom ROM will be flashed with the second bank of the standard Sinclair 128K ROM.

It is important to note that for custom ROMs, fast loading of taps can be used, but the loading should be started manually, considering the possibility that the "traps" of the ROM loading routine might not work depending on the flashed ROM. For example, with Rodolfo Guerra's ROMs, both loading and recording traps using the SAVE command work perfectly.

Finally, keep in mind that when updating the firmware, you will need to re-flash the custom ROMs afterward, so I recommend leaving the files "48custom.rom" and "128custom.rom" on the card for the custom ROMs you wish to use.

## MIDI Support

The emulator supports MIDI output on RP2350 boards only. Enable it in the OSD menu: **Audio → MIDI**.

Four modes are available:

- **AY** — Decodes bit-bang UART transmitted through AY-3-8912 register 14 (IOPortA, bit 2). Software like [zx-midiplayer](https://github.com/UzixLS/zx-midiplayer) uses this method in "128std" / "TS1" / "TS2" output modes. MIDI bytes are sent to an external synth via UART TX pin at 31250 baud.
- **ShamaZX** — Emulates the ShamaZX parallel MIDI interface (SAM2695 synth module). Port 0xA0CF is used for TX data, port 0xA1CF for status (bit 6 = busy). This corresponds to the "ShamaZX" output mode in [zx-midiplayer](https://github.com/UzixLS/zx-midiplayer). Output via UART TX pin.
- **Software** — Built-in software MIDI synthesizer. No external hardware needed — MIDI is synthesized directly on the RP2350 and mixed into the audio output. Supports 16-voice polyphony, General MIDI program changes, velocity, channel volume, expression, pan, and pitch bend. Works with both AY bit-bang and ShamaZX protocols. When Software mode is selected, a **Synth Preset** submenu appears with 8 presets:
  - **GM** — General MIDI mapping: different waveforms per instrument family (triangle for piano/pipes, saw for strings/bass, square for organs/brass, noise for percussion).
  - **Piano** — All instruments rendered as triangle wave with natural decay.
  - **Chiptune** — All square wave with varied duty cycles, no filtering — classic 8-bit sound.
  - **Strings** — All saw wave, slow attack, long sustain, warm low-pass filter.
  - **Rock** — Bright and punchy: saw for most instruments, square for organ/brass/reed.
  - **Organ** — All square wave (75% duty), sustained tone with minimal decay.
  - **Music Box** — Triangle wave with fast decay and low sustain — delicate and percussive.
  - **Synth** — All saw wave with medium low-pass filter.
- **GM.DLS Wavetable** — A fixed-point General MIDI **wavetable** synthesizer that plays a real GM sound bank, for far more realistic instruments than the procedural Software synth. No external hardware. You supply the bank (`gm_bank.bin`): pack it once on a PC, copy it to the SD card, and select this mode — the device installs the bank into a dedicated flash partition on the next boot (one-time write, ~20–30 s, LED blinks). The bank then persists across reboots and firmware updates.

### GM.DLS instrument bank

The GM.DLS wavetable mode needs a packed `gm_bank.bin` on the SD card — it is **not** included, you provide your own. Convert a sound bank on a PC with the bundled pure-Python tools (no dependencies), packed at the emulator's 31250 Hz rate:

- DLS bank (e.g. Microsoft `gm.dls`): `python3 tools/dls_pack.py gm.dls gm_bank.bin 31250`
- GUS / freepats patch set: `python3 tools/gus_pack.py timidity.cfg gm_bank.bin 31250`

Copy the resulting `gm_bank.bin` (~1.6 MB, 8-bit µ-law) to `/gm_bank.bin` or `/.config/pico-speccy/gm_bank.bin` on the SD card, then select **Audio → MIDI → GM.DLS Wavetable**. To update/reinstall, drop a new bank on SD and re-select the mode (confirm the reinstall prompt). When the SD card holds more than one bank, an **Instrument set** picker lets you choose which one to install. Requires a board with ≥ 4 MB flash.

> Microsoft's `gm.dls` is copyrighted and **not redistributable** — pack your own copy for personal use, or use the freely-licensed [freepats](https://freepats.zenvoid.org/) GUS set.

The GM.DLS wavetable engine and the `dls_pack` / `gus_pack` conversion tools are based on **[xrip/embedded-midi-synth](https://github.com/xrip/embedded-midi-synth)** — thanks to **[@xrip](https://github.com/xrip)**. Full details: the [MIDI wiki page](https://github.com/drewpo28/pico-speccy/wiki/EN-MIDI).

### MIDI TX Pin Configuration

The MIDI TX pin is configured per board in `CMakeLists.txt` via `MIDI_TX_PIN`. Default values by board:

| Board | MIDI_TX_PIN |
|-------|-------------|
| Murmulator | 22 |
| Waveshare PiZero | 26 |
| Pimoroni Pico DV | 21 |
| Olimex RP2040-PICO-PC | 22 |

**Note:** On Murmulator boards, MIDI TX and real tape input share the same pin (GPIO 22). When MIDI is enabled, real tape loading is disabled. Disable MIDI in the menu to use real tape input.

### Connecting to Raspberry Pi 3/4 as MIDI Host

You can use a Raspberry Pi 3 or 4 as a USB MIDI host with a hardware synth or software synthesizer (e.g. FluidSynth).

**Wiring** (directly, no optocoupler needed for short connections):

```
RP2350 Board              Raspberry Pi 3/4
─────────────             ────────────────
MIDI_TX_PIN  ──────────── GPIO 15 (RXD, pin 10)
+5V          ──────────── +5V (e.g. pin 2)
GND          ──────────── GND (e.g. pin 6)
```

## Network (ZiFi / ESP-01S)

On RP2350 boards, an **ESP-01S** (ESP8266) module on the UART adds networking. It runs the **stock Espressif AT firmware** — no reflashing needed. Configured under the OSD **Network** menu:

- **ZiFi NIC** — network interface for ZX-Spectrum software (port `#EF`, 16550-UART window); works with the **MRF** terminal/drivers (<https://zxart.ee/eng/software/prikladnoe-po/mrf/tabs:releases/>).
- **WiFi** — scan / connect / autoconnect; **SNTP** time sync into the RTC.
- **FTP server** — share the SD card over the LAN (anonymous, active mode).
- **HTTP test (curl)** — fetch an arbitrary URL and show the result (TLS-over-ESP diagnostic).

File access (FTP/SFTP and the online archives) lives in the **F5 file browser** when WiFi is configured — a location chooser drawn in the same "Open File" window:

- **Local (SD)** — the SD card.
- **Remote (FTP/SFTP)** — saved connections (optional alias + start path; password optionally stored, masked entry with TAB reveal, SFTP host-key TOFU). Browse / download / upload / copy (recursive) / delete; baud 115200–921600.
- **Web Archives** — online ZX catalogs (Virtual TR-DOS, Spectrum Computing, ZX-Art) over HTTPS.
- **Add Remote** — store a new FTP/SFTP connection.

In any of these, **Enter** quick-starts a file (download to RAM and run/mount) and **F5** saves it to a chosen SD folder; `..`/Backspace go up, Esc closes.

Wiring is just **4 wires** (TX, RX, GND, 3V3 — TX/RX crossover; EN/RST/GPIO0/GPIO2 left unconnected). Alternatively, the ESP-01S can be connected over USB through a **CH340 / CP210x / FTDI USB-serial dongle** instead of the GPIO UART. Per-board default pins and full details: **[Network wiki page](https://github.com/drewpo28/pico-speccy/wiki/EN-Network)** ([RU](https://github.com/drewpo28/pico-speccy/wiki/Network)).

## How to build
### Windows 10+
 - Install VSCode [pico-setup-windows-x64-standalone.exe](https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-setup-windows/releases) it will tune up environment and install default SDK 1.5.1;
 - In VSCode install [Raspberry Pi Pico](https://t.me/ZX_MURMULATOR/42804/194110) plugin, to make other SDK versions available and auto-load;
 - Import this project, and agree on all requests from the plugin (it may be required to wait some times on these steps);
 - Tune up build to be [Pico/Release](https://t.me/ZX_MURMULATOR/42804/214274)
 - Set required variables in your local copy of [CMakeLists.txt](https://github.com/drewpo28/pico-speccy/blob/main/CMakeLists.txt)
 - [Clean/Reconfigure](https://t.me/ZX_MURMULATOR/42804/214276)
 - Build.
### Linux
 - Install dependencies: build-essential, gcc-arm-none-eabi
 - Clone pico-sdk from [its repository](https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-sdk) into directory near this project.
`git clone --recursive https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-sdk`
Your filesystem tree must be look like:
```
 Base folder
   |-- pico-sdk
   |-- pico-speccy
        |-- build
        |-- drivers
        |-- src
```
 - Configure building options in `pico-speccy/CMakeLists.txt` - pico board, video&audio output, etc.

#### CMake build options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `-DMURM=ON` | Build for Murmulator 1.x |
| `-DMURM2=ON` | Build for Murmulator 2.0 (default) |
| `-DPICO_PC=ON` | Build for Olimex RP2040-PICO-PC carrier board |
| `-DPICO_DV=ON` | Build for Pimoroni Pico DV Demo Base |
| `-DZERO2=ON` | Build for Waveshare RP2350-PiZero |
| `-DZERO2_PIO_USB=ON` | ZERO2: USB host on the second Type-C port (J2, PIO-USB on GP28/GP29). **Default OFF** — the bit-banged host costs ~18 KB of SRAM (RAM-resident code + endpoint pool), so it ships as a separate `z0p2-speccy-VGA-HDMI-PIOUSB-*.uf2` image instead. |
| `-DVGA_HDMI=ON` | VGA/HDMI output (default) |
| `-DSOFTTV=ON` | Software composite TV output |
| `-DTV=ON` | Hardware composite TV output |
| `-DTFT=ON` | TFT display output |
| `-DILI9341=ON` | ILI9341 TFT display output |
| `-DPICO_PC_DBG_UART=ON` | PICO_PC: enable UART0 on DBG1 header (GP0=TX, GP1=RX) for Debug Probe. Auto-remaps PS/2 keyboard to GP10/GP11 to free the pins. |
| `-DTFT_ST7789=ON` | ST7789 TFT display variant |

#### Multi-target build script

To build firmware for all supported boards and display variants at once, use the `build_all.sh` / `build_all.bat` / `build_all.ps1` scripts in the project root. They build each `(target, display)` pair in its own directory (`build-<TARGET>[-<DISPLAY>]/`) and collect `.uf2` artifacts into `pico-speccy/firmware/`.

```
./build_all.sh [--clean] [-j JOBS_PER_BUILD] [-p MAX_PARALLEL] [TARGETS...]
```

- Targets: `MURM MURM2 PICO_PC PICO_DV ZERO2` (default: all)
- ZERO2 builds twice: the plain image and a `PIOUSB` one (`-DZERO2_PIO_USB=ON`, USB host on the second Type-C)
- `--clean` — wipe build dirs first (default: incremental rebuild)
- `-j` — threads per target build (default: `nproc / MAX_PARALLEL`)
- `-p` — max number of targets built concurrently (default: 3)
- Env vars: `BUILD_TYPE` (default `MinSizeRel`), `MAX_PARALLEL`, `JOBS_PER_BUILD`, `CMAKE_GENERATOR`
- Uses `ccache` automatically if installed (`apt install ccache` for ~2-5× faster rebuilds)
- Per-target logs are written to `build-logs/`

Single-target builds produce artifacts in `pico-speccy/bin/`.
